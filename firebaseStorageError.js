The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the provided `storageBucket` in your Firebase configuration is incorrect or doesn't match the bucket used to store your files.  This often happens if you're using a different project in your Firebase console than the one specified in your app's `google-services.json` file.  Incorrect configuration may also lead to authentication failures when attempting to access the storage.
